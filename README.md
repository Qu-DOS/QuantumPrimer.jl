# QComp.jl
A library to collect and standardize QML routines.

# workflow
1. Open a branch with a name suggesting the feature that is being implemented, e.g. "qcnn-invariant"
2. Work on the branch to implement the feature
3. Once the feature is complete, open a pull request to merge with main and WAIT for someone to check the pull request
4. Do not enforce any merge, ever!
